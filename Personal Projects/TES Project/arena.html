                <p><i>The Elder Scrolls: Arena</i> is the first game in the <i>Elder Scrolls</i> series, released in 1994. The story follows the betrayal of <b>Emperor Uriel Septim VII</b> by his Imperial Battlemage, <b>Jagar Tharn</b>, who imprisons the Emperor in another realm and assumes his identity.</p>

                <p>You, the player, take on the role of the <b>Eternal Champion</b>, tasked with rescuing the Emperor. Guided by the spirit of <b>Ria Silmane</b>, Tharn’s former apprentice, you must travel across <b>Tamriel</b> to find the pieces of the <b>Staff of Chaos</b>, the only artifact capable of breaking Tharn’s spell and freeing Uriel Septim VII.</p>

                <p>Your journey takes you through various provinces, dungeons, and cities, battling Tharn’s minions and uncovering secrets. Once the Staff is fully restored, you confront Tharn in the <b>Imperial Palace</b>, defeat him, and restore the rightful Emperor to the throne, bringing peace back to Tamriel.</p>
