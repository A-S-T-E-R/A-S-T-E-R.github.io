                <p><i>The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion</i> is the fourth game in the <i>Elder Scrolls</i> series, released in 2006. The story takes place in the province of <b>Cyrodiil</b> during the <b>Oblivion Crisis</b>, a catastrophic event where portals to the Daedric realm of <b>Oblivion</b> begin appearing across Tamriel.</p>

                <p>The game begins with <b>Emperor Uriel Septim VII</b> attempting to flee the Imperial City after learning that assassins have killed his sons. Before his death, he entrusts the <b>Amulet of Kings</b> to the player, a prisoner whom he has seen in his dreams, with instructions to "close shut the jaws of Oblivion."</p>

                <p>The player must find <b>Jauffre</b>, the leader of the Blades, and locate <b>Martin Septim</b>, the Emperor’s illegitimate son and the last surviving heir to the throne. As the Oblivion Gates continue to open, the player works to rally allies, retrieve ancient artifacts, and ultimately stop the Daedric Prince <b>Mehrunes Dagon</b> and his cult, the <b>Mythic Dawn</b>, from conquering Tamriel.</p>

                <p>The climax of the story sees Martin using the Amulet of Kings to transform into the avatar of <b>Akatosh</b>, battling Mehrunes Dagon and sealing the Oblivion Gates forever, sacrificing himself in the process. With the Empire saved but without an Emperor, Tamriel enters a new uncertain era.</p>
